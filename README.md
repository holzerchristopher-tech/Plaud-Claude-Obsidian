# Plaud → Claude → Obsidian Audio Pipeline

Automatically transcribe Plaud audio recordings and convert them into structured Obsidian notes using AI — fully local, no third-party cloud services required beyond the Anthropic API.

## Why This Exists

Plaud recordings are great for capturing meetings, field notes, and voice memos — but getting that content into a usable, searchable format is tedious. This pipeline eliminates that friction entirely:

1. Record on your Plaud device
2. Sync to iCloud
3. Find a structured, summarized note in Obsidian within minutes — automatically

No manual steps. No copy-pasting. No subscription services beyond what you already use.

## How It Works
